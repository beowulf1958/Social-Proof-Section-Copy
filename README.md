## Overview

The goal for this project is to organize my Sass and make use of reusable code to speed up my development in future projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

Went mobile first. Then did some experimentation to get the elements to stagger; fairly easy using flexbox and justify-self,
I was able to organize differently this time; we shall see if this is a solid, scalable architechture.
Could not get the background images to work. Also, when they sometimes show up, I can barely see them.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass/scss

### What I learned

Got to brush up on grid-areas. It is a nice way to layout, but does not behave the way I thought it would.

### Continued development

Continue on refining the organization of the Sass.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank @Neitodesu for help on this project. The well organized Sass structure on their projects helped me to rethink how I use my partials and organize them in folders for my own work.
