## Overview

The goal for this project is to organize my Sass and make use of reusable code to speed up my development in future projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

Went mobile first. Then did some experimentation to get the elements to stagger; fairly easy using flexbox and justify-self,
I was able to organize differently this time; we shall see if this is a solid, scalable architechture.
Could not get the background images to work. Also, when they sometimes show up, I can barely see them.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass/scss

### What I learned

Got to brush up on grid-areas. It is a nice way to layout, but does not behave the way I thought it would.

### Continued development

Continue on refining the organization of the Sass.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank @Neitodesu for help on this project. The well organized Sass structure on their projects helped me to rethink how I use my partials and organize them in folders for my own work.
